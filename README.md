# SortingAlgorithmVisualizerTool
This is a web application, Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, which I made using React. 
This application generates a new array every time it reloads, and also has a "Generate New Array" button to make a new random array.
Able to visualize Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort. 
The project demonstrates how these common algorithms go about sorting an array, and lets the user see how much faster one algorithm is than another.
This project was made using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
